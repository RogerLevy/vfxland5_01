# Nib 2.0 Phase 1 Implementation Summary

## Completed Changes

### 1. Enhanced File Header and Documentation
- Added comprehensive phase documentation explaining current and future phases
- Marked all future enhancement points in comments
- Clear section markers for each change

### 2. Class Size Expansion
```forth
\ Changed from:
1024 constant /class

\ To:
4096 constant /class
```

### 3. Static Structure Enhancement
```forth
\ Added new field-based static structure:
1024 constant #max-classifiers

0 
#max-classifiers 8 / field bit-table    \ 128 bytes for 1024-bit classifier table
cell field class-size                   \ Size of this class
cell field next-field-offset            \ Next field offset for this class
constant /static-base

/static-base value /static
```

### 4. Enhanced Initialization
```forth
\ Added hot-reload support:
: restore-static-base ( - )
    [ /static-base ] literal to /static ;
```

### 5. Future Enhancement Markers
- Added comment in `::` word indicating future classifier validation
- Marked `/class` expansion purpose for future field registries
- Documented complete phase roadmap

## Preserved Functionality

All existing functionality remains exactly the same:
- Object runtime (`me`, `[[`, `]]`, `'s`)
- Class definition (`class:`, `field`, `static`)
- Message system (`m:`, `::`)
- Object instantiation (`>object`)
- Validation functions (`valid-class?`, `valid-object?`)

## Test Results

Created `engineer/test-nib2.vfx` to verify:
- ✓ Basic object creation and messaging works
- ✓ New constants are properly defined
- ✓ Class size expansion is effective
- ✓ /static-base infrastructure is available

## File Size

Final nib2.vfx: 210 lines (target was 500 lines for complete implementation)
This leaves ample room for the remaining phases.

## Foundation Ready

The foundation is now prepared for:
- Phase 2: Classifier bit allocation system
- Phase 3: Field type registry and protocols  
- Phase 4: Enhanced message dispatch with classifier checks
- Phase 5: Advanced object creation with type validation
