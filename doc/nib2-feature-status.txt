CURRENT STATUS SUMMARY
=======================

Overall Completion: ~45%

Core systems working:
- Object runtime and scoping
- Property-based field system  
- Class and trait definition
- Runtime type queries (is?)
- Basic object creation infrastructure
- Trait composition with is-a
- Protocol definition with default implementations
- Protocol dispatch with fallback behavior
- Multiple trait composition support
- Property mapping and conflict handling

Major systems pending:
- Protocol implementation syntax (::)
- Class inheritance (derive)
- Lifecycle management (object%, setup:, init/deinit)
- Scope enforcement (public/private validation)
- Advanced validation and error handling
- Enhanced object creation (does-xt, SETUP execution)
- Stack diagram validation for protocols

Critical missing features from specification:
- object% system trait with lifecycle protocols
- Automatic SETUP/init execution in object creation
- Public scope enforcement for traits, properties, statics
- Redefinition prevention for classes and traits
- Enhanced $create-object and create-object signatures

The foundation provides basic functionality but requires significant work
to match the full specification requirements.
