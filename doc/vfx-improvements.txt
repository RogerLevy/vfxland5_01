VFX Forth Improvement Suggestions
==================================

1. Disallow single non-alphanumeric character local names
   - Currently allows {: xt - :} where "-" becomes a local variable name
   - This is confusing and error-prone
   - Should only allow meaningful alphanumeric names for locals
   - Single punctuation characters should be reserved for syntax/operators

2. Close included file on QUIT
   - When QUIT is executed during file inclusion, the file handle should be closed
   - Currently leaves files open which can cause resource leaks
   - Important for interactive development with frequent restarts

3. Enable showing error locations in EVALUATEd strings
   - Include line numbers and context from evaluated strings in error messages
