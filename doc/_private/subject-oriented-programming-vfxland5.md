# Subject-Oriented Programming for VFXLand5/02

## Overview

VFXLand5's current object system has evolved into a proto-Subject-Oriented Programming (SOP) architecture. Rather than traditional object-oriented inheritance, the system uses multiple "subjects" (specialized perspectives) that operate on shared object data. This document outlines the evolution toward a more formal SOP system for VFXLand5/02.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Proto-SOP Architecture

VFXLand5 already demonstrates SOP principles:

**Shared Object Structure:**
- Common fields (`x`, `y`, `en`, `bmp`, etc.)
- Fixed 512-byte memory layout
- Pool-based allocation (actors, elements, temps)

**Multiple Subject Perspectives:**
- **Actor subject**: sees sprites with physics, behavior, collision
- **UI subject**: sees elements with hierarchy, transforms, visibility
- **Tween subject**: sees animation targets with interpolatable properties
- **Timer subject**: sees delayed execution containers

Each subject provides:
- Distinct creation patterns (`one` vs `el` vs timer creation)
- Subject-specific iteration (`actives>` vs UI traversal)
- Independent lifecycle management
- Specialized vocabulary and operations

### Why Traditional Consolidation Failed

Previous attempts to unify everything into a single object type failed because they ignored the fundamental reality: **these are different conceptual domains operating on shared data**, not variations of the same thing. Forth is naturally "topic-oriented" rather than object-oriented.

## SOP Architecture for VFXLand5/02

### Subject Definition

A **subject** is a specialized perspective or domain of concern that can be applied to objects. Each subject defines:

1. **Fields**: What data it needs to track
2. **Behavior**: How it participates in the game loop
3. **System Integration**: How it hooks into physics/rendering/input/etc.
4. **Vocabulary**: The words that operate on objects from this perspective

### Proposed Game Subjects

**Core Subjects:**
- **Visual subject**: position, appearance, rendering properties
- **Spatial subject**: collision bounds, spatial relationships
- **Temporal subject**: time-based state, animation timing
- **File subject**: asset loading, hot-reload, caching

**Specialized Game Subjects:**
- **Rigid body physics**: mass, forces, velocities, constraints
- **Tilemap collisions**: grid-based collision detection
- **Player-controlled propulsion**: input-responsive movement
- **Tileset-based animation**: sprite strips with frame timing
- **Skeletal animation**: bone hierarchies and deformation
- **Key and lock system**: access control mechanisms
- **Advanced sprite rendering**: scale, rotate, skew, tint transformations

### Cross-Domain Object Classifications

Objects can participate in multiple classification schemes:

- **Visual objects**: actors, UI elements, particles, effects
- **File objects**: bitmaps, samples, scripts, data files
- **Temporal objects**: timers, tweens, animations
- **Spatial objects**: actors, collision zones, triggers

## Compile-Time Composition System

### The `includes` Mechanism

Replace fixed 512-byte layouts with compile-time composition:

```forth
\ Define a composite object type
composite ship%
  includes visual-subject    \ x, y, bmp, alpha fields
  includes spatial-subject   \ collision bounds w, h
  includes physics-subject   \ velocity, mass, forces
  includes input-subject     \ control bindings
  includes audio-subject     \ sound trigger fields
composite;
```

### Offset Table Architecture

Instead of fixed field layouts, use subject-specific field maps that can share storage:

```forth
\ Visual subject fields
static vis.x     \ position
static vis.y
static vis.bmp   \ appearance
static vis.alpha

\ Spatial subject fields (shares position)
static spt.x     \ same storage as vis.x
static spt.y     \ same storage as vis.y
static spt.w     \ collision width
static spt.h     \ collision height

\ Physics subject fields
static phy.vx    \ velocity
static phy.vy
static phy.mass
```

### Advanced `includes` Capabilities

**Subject Interface Validation:**
```forth
spatial-subject requires: x y w h
visual-subject requires: x y bmp

\ Compile-time error if ship% includes spatial but lacks required fields
```

**Automatic Method Synthesis:**
```forth
includes visual-subject
\ Auto-generates: ship-x@ ship-y@ ship-bmp@ etc.

includes spatial-subject  
\ Auto-generates: ship-bounds@ ship-hit? etc.
```

**Cross-Subject Field Sharing:**
```forth
\ Compiler detects shared fields and optimizes layout
visual-subject: x y bmp alpha
spatial-subject: x y w h
\ x,y automatically shared in memory layout
```

**Subject Dependencies:**
```forth
physics-subject depends-on: spatial-subject
animation-subject depends-on: visual-subject temporal-subject
\ Automatic inclusion of dependencies
```

**System Integration Hooks:**
```forth
includes physics-subject     \ → auto-registers with physics update
includes input-subject       \ → auto-registers with input polling  
includes tilemap-collision   \ → auto-uses tilemap collision detection
includes sprite-animation    \ → auto-updates animation frames
```

**Message Routing Optimization:**
```forth
ship% receives: collision-msg → spatial-subject
ship% receives: render-msg → visual-subject
\ Direct dispatch, no runtime lookup
```

## Advantages Over Traditional ECS

**Compile-Time vs Runtime Composition:**
- Traditional ECS: Components attached at runtime, virtual dispatch overhead
- VFXLand5 SOP: Subject viewpoints determined at compile-time, direct field access

**Memory Layout Control:**
- Traditional ECS: Components scattered across memory, cache-unfriendly
- VFXLand5 SOP: Optimized layout with shared fields, cache-friendly pools

**Forth-Native Architecture:**
- Traditional ECS: Object-oriented with inheritance complexity
- VFXLand5 SOP: Word-based subjects align with Forth's vocabulary approach

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Zero runtime component lookup overhead
- Direct field access through compile-time offset resolution
- Maintained pool-based allocation benefits
- Cache-friendly memory layout

## Conclusion

The Subject-Oriented Programming approach represents a natural evolution of VFXLand5's existing architecture. By formalizing the implicit subject system already present and adding compile-time composition capabilities, VFXLand5/02 can achieve the flexibility of modern component systems while maintaining Forth's performance characteristics and natural vocabulary-based approach.

This architecture addresses the core tension between rapid development velocity and long-term maintainability by providing clear conceptual boundaries while allowing efficient composition and reuse of functionality.
