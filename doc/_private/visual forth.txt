codebase


rectangle
	probably best to start here. 
		create (with "rectangle tool")
		move
		resize
		delete
		duplicate

table
binary
label
string
number
textbox
slider
button

pixel editor
tilemap editor



two modes
	user
		some things are movable/resizable/duplicated/deleted (this is how they are "used")
		some things are "usables"
			inputs and other value widgets
			buttons
			pixel editor
			selectors / pluckers
		right-click behavior is also class-defined
	designer
		usables can now be moved/resized
		right-clicking opens an editing context menu
		a few things are locked and can't be changed within the UI
			(they are defined solely in code)


i wonder if i could make money from this project ...



storage
	built-in classes
		for example "word" ("token"?), or "number"
	saving
		analyze the tree
			tokenize non-built-in classes
			store them at the beginning of the file
				(this is actually mostly to let us load any needed scripts before doing anything, but it also keeps file size down)
			if we run out of tokens (255) write additional class names in full
			token 0 means end of list
		write the tree recursively
			token / byte-counted class name
			body
				class-defined
					numbers are stored in binary
					strings & arrays are stored as chunks (cell count + data)

code editor
	user mode
		click to edit words
		drag words around
		shift-click to select
		shift-drag to select multiple?
		right-click for options
	designer mode
		click to select
		resize elements


you can "decorate" your code by locking it and attaching stuff to the container
	if you put for example a bitmap in your code it will be inserted as an executable object, returning its ID
		at runtime.




"number" variants
	keyboard entry
	dropdown selection
	slider
	pot


multi-edit
	select multiple and ...
