> summarize the commits since 8am; what were the main kinds of tasks i worked on and what were the
   other kinds of tasks as well?

● Let me check the git log for today's commits. Today is 2025-08-20 according to the environment
  info.

● Bash(git log --since="2025-08-20 08:00" --oneline)
  ⎿  77c55be (Supershow) Add test-scene.vfx
     248e5c5 (Claude) Update commit.md
     a5316ac (NIBS) Update SERBIN
     … +22 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Main task categories from today's work:

  NIBS System Development (Primary focus)
  - Multiple updates to serialization system (SERBIN, READBIN)
  - Object system improvements (CLASS;, IS-A, WORKS-WITH)
  - Code formatting and debugging support (.CLASS, .TRAIT, .LIST)

  Supershow Engine Work
  - Scene testing infrastructure (test-scene.vfx)
  - Load sequence standardization
  - Autoclass system fixes

  Engineer Core
  - Fixed interpreter issues (>INTERPRET)
  - Property type declarations and reference handling

  Testing & Quality
  - Asset system testing (test-as.vfx)
  - Code polishing and duplicate removal
  - Re-enabled validation checks

  Documentation/Meta
  - Multiple Claude commit.md updates
  - General todo list maintenance

  The work focused heavily on the NIBS (serialization) system with supporting engine improvements
  and testing infrastructure.

> redo the summary to be very concise and conversational, not detailed lists

● Looking at today's commits since 8am - you mainly worked on the NIBS serialization system,
  fixing various parts like READBIN and updating CLASS-related functionality. You also did some
  Supershow engine work including adding scene testing and fixing the autoclass system. There was
  some cleanup too - removing duplicates, polishing code, and updating documentation. Plus a bit
  of Engineer core work fixing the interpreter.

  Basically a mix of low-level system work on NIBS, engine improvements, and general maintenance.

> that last sentence was spot-on stylistically.  how to prompt engineer for that style?

● For that casual, summary style, you'd want prompts like:

  - "Give me the gist in one sentence"
  - "What's the bottom line?"
  - "Sum it up in plain terms"
  - "Just the essence, no fluff"
  - "What did I basically do?"

  The key triggers seem to be words like "basically," "gist," "bottom line," or "essence" - they
  signal you want the distilled version, not the breakdown. Adding "plain terms" or
  "conversational" helps avoid technical listing.

  You could also explicitly say "skip the details" or "no lists" to prevent the structured format
  that AI tends to default to.

> and how to prompt engineer for the paragraph-style?

● For the paragraph style (like the first part of my response), prompt with:

  - "Tell me about X" or "Walk me through X"
  - "Give me a narrative summary"
  - "Describe what happened"
  - "Explain it conversationally"
  - "Write it as prose, not bullet points"
