safe variable serialization
	PERSISTENT ( <wordlist> - )  \ if no wordlist, assume FORTH?
		looks at last word
		variable? value? cstring? iterable? create?
			create a word in PERSISTENTS with the size and address
		
	SER-GLOBALS ( - )
		walk CONTEXT
			write out the name, size, and data   (make this action a word)
			increment count

	DESER-GLOBALS ( - )
		fetch count
		loop
			fetch name 
			name in CONTEXT?
				fetch size and read min( size, persistent.size ) into persistent.addr  (make this action a word)
            else
                log error
                skip the data

we should also update the object serialization system with sizes and
    error logging (as opposed to aborting)
