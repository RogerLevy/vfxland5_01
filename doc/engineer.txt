Engineer started as a test/example/lab for game-making tools.
(e.g. words, systems, maybe even editor apps???)
Right now I'm thinking about treating main.f as a "layer"
on top of Engineer, which was meant to be as simple as possible,
nothing more than a platform to develop games interactively,
including any needed tools and "engines"...

i.e. vfxland5 v1 (tied to Engineer version, probably.)

One thing is clear, I want to take only baby steps and learn
from finished/released projects.  And keep the code to a minimum,
where possible!!! Engineer has been slightly complicated as a result
of the complexity of fulfilling my requirements against how Windows
and Allegro 5 work.  Otherwise some things would be clunky/unusable.

Engineer 1 has become fixed to developing 320x240 games in a scaled
window.  This is great.  Need more fixed functionality in
every area possible.
