 I found 57+ file-related functions across the engineer directory. Here's the organized breakdown:

  Core File I/O (fstools.vfx)

  Basic Operations:
  - WD@ - Get current working directory
  - FSIZE - Get file size in bytes
  - BYTES-LEFT - Get bytes remaining in open file
  - FILE, - Compile binary file into memory

  High-Level I/O:
  - WRITE{ ... WRITE} - Bracket notation for file writing
  - DATA, - Write raw data
  - LINE, - Write line with newline
  - WRITE - Single-operation file write
  - READ - Single-operation file read
  - LOAD-FILE - Allocate and load entire file

  Directory Operations:
  - DIR-EXISTS? - Check if directory exists
  - ENSURE-DIR - Create directory with error handling
  - FIND-DAT-PATH - Locate dat/ asset directory

  Directory Enumeration (each-file.vfx)

  - EACH-FILE - Execute code for each file in directory
  - EACH-FILE-AND-DIR - Execute for files and directories

  Path Manipulation (file-fix.vfx)

  - >ABSPATH - Convert to absolute canonical path
  - NORMALIZE - Full path canonicalization
  - SLASHES - Convert forward to backslashes
  - -PATH - Strip to filename only
  - ENDING - Extract string after character
  - INCLUDED / INCLUDE - Include file with path fixing
  - REQUIRED / REQUIRE - Conditional include
  - .SOURCES - List all included source files

  File Listing (ls.vfx)

  - LS - List directory contents with colors
  - FILE-COLOR - Get color code by file extension

  Allegro 5 Bindings (allegro-5.2.5.vfx)

  Filesystem Entry API:
  - AL_CREATE_FS_ENTRY / AL_DESTROY_FS_ENTRY
  - AL_OPEN_DIRECTORY / AL_READ_DIRECTORY / AL_CLOSE_DIRECTORY
  - AL_GET_FS_ENTRY_NAME / AL_GET_FS_ENTRY_MODE / AL_GET_FS_ENTRY_MTIME

  Asset Loading:
  - AL_LOAD_BITMAP / AL_LOAD_FONT / AL_LOAD_SAMPLE / AL_LOAD_AUDIO_STREAM

  Native File Dialog:
  - AL_CREATE_NATIVE_FILE_DIALOG / AL_SHOW_NATIVE_FILE_DIALOG
  - AL_GET_NATIVE_FILE_DIALOG_PATH / AL_GET_NATIVE_FILE_DIALOG_COUNT

  VFX Forth Standard (vfxcore2.vfx)

  - OPEN-FILE / CLOSE-FILE / READ-FILE / WRITE-FILE
  - FILE-SIZE / FILE-POSITION / FILE-EXISTS?
  - CREATE-FILE / DELETE-FILE

  The main files are:
  - engineer/fstools.vfx:1
  - engineer/each-file.vfx:1
  - engineer/file-fix.vfx:1
  - engineer/ls.vfx:1
  - engineer/allegro-5.2.5.vfx:1
