PATH SYSTEM STATUS
==================
Text format file for tracking Path System development status.

TODO SECTION
============

[ ] Add `progress` word for explicit progress specification in easing DSL
[ ] Add `segsync` and `nextsync` words for automatic segment boundary sync
[ ] Add `shave` word for smooth waypoint transitions with automatic defaults
[ ] Implement transition segment velocity calculation and interpolation

DATED ENTRIES
=============

2025-07-09
----------
Path system analysis completed. Current bezier curve system with arc-length 
parameterization is functional but needs:
- Better easing DSL (progress-based, segment sync)
- Smooth waypoint transitions to eliminate motion jerks

Enhancement designs completed for progress words and transition zones.
