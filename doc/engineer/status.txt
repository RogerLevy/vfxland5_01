ENGINEER IDE STATUS
===================
Text format file for tracking Engineer IDE development status.

TODO SECTION
============

[ ] Add mechanisms for conditional loading of contract definition files
    - Develop conventions for detecting whether Oversight is loaded
    - Allow projects to optionally include contract files only when Oversight is available
    - Prevent errors when contract words are used but Oversight not loaded

[ ] Review Oversight integration
    - Currently only loads when debug mode is enabled
    - Consider making Oversight loading more explicit/configurable

[ ] Add asset hot-reloading improvements
    - Current reload-bitmaps exists but needs testing
    - Consider automatic reloading on file changes

[ ] Improve REPL integration for debugging
    - Enhanced debugging capabilities
    - Better error handling and recovery

[ ] Documentation improvements
    - Add comprehensive API documentation
    - Document conventions and patterns used

----------
Engineer IDE is stable and functional. Recent improvements include:
- Reformatted all section headings for better visual organization
- Consolidated core dependencies (misc.vfx, scope.vfx, error.vfx, format.vfx, array.vfx, oop.vfx) 
- Moved system integration functions (bye, path) to appropriate location
- Oversight integration is working but only loads in debug mode
- All major subsystems (graphics, input, event handling, REPL) are operational

Current structure provides a solid foundation for 2D game development with:
- Allegro 5 integration for graphics/audio/input
- Automatic bitmap loading system  
- Object-oriented programming support
- Contract-oriented debugging via Oversight (when enabled)
- Live REPL for interactive development
