# Contract Architecture Insights

## The Late-Binding Problem in Forth

### Discovery
While implementing contract-oriented debugging for VFXLand5, we discovered a fundamental constraint of Forth compilation that dictates contract system architecture.

### The Problem
**Forth words capture execution tokens (XTs) at definition time, not execution time.**

```forth
: word1 ... ;                    \ Original definition
: word2 word1 ... ;             \ Captures XT of unwrapped word1
validate-something before word1  \ Wraps word1, but word2 still calls original
word2                           \ Calls unwrapped word1 - validation bypassed!
```

### Why This Happens
- Forth compilation resolves word references immediately during `:` definition
- Once compiled, word calls cannot be redirected to wrapped versions
- This is fundamental to Forth's compilation model, not a bug or limitation

### Solutions Explored

#### 1. Post-Definition Wrapping (Failed)
**Attempt:** Apply contracts after words are defined
**Problem:** Internal calls already captured unwrapped XTs
**Result:** Incomplete validation coverage

#### 2. Runtime Indirection (Rejected)
**Attempt:** Use execution tokens and `execute` for late binding
**Problem:** Performance overhead, complexity, breaks Forth idioms
**Result:** Too expensive for game development

#### 3. Deferred Contract Application (Circular)
**Attempt:** Hook into `;` to auto-apply contracts as words are defined
**Insight:** This is just define-before with extra steps
**Result:** Same ordering constraint, more complexity

### The Only Workable Solution: Define-Before Contracts

**Contracts must be defined before the words they validate.**

```forth
\ Correct approach:
validate-something before word1  \ Define contract first
: word1 ... ;                   \ Gets wrapped immediately
: word2 word1 ... ;             \ Captures XT of wrapped word1
word2                           \ Calls validated word1 ✓
```

### Architectural Implications

#### File Organization
```
module/
├── module-contracts.vfx  # Load first
└── module.vfx           # Load second
```

#### Development Workflow
1. Define validation requirements first
2. Implement business logic second
3. Internal word calls automatically get validation

#### Benefits
- **Universal coverage** - All calls are validated
- **Clean separation** - Contracts separate from business logic
- **Performance** - No runtime overhead for validation dispatch
- **Simplicity** - Works with Forth's natural compilation model

### Key Insight
**The ordering constraint isn't a limitation to overcome - it's the correct architecture.**

Fighting against Forth's compilation model leads to complexity and compromise. Working with it leads to clean, fast, comprehensive validation.

### Lesson Learned
Sometimes the obvious solution really is the best one. The exploration of alternatives wasn't wasted - it proved why define-before contracts is not just workable, but optimal for Forth-based systems.
