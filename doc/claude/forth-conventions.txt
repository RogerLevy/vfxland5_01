# VFX Forth Conventions for Claude

This document captures Forth-specific patterns and gotchas to help Claude avoid common mistakes in future sessions.

## Loop Constructs
- Loop counters (`i`, `j`, `k`) are automatic in `for`/`do` loops - don't declare as locals
- Example: `arr #items for i arr [] @ ... loop` (i is provided automatically)

## Compile-Time vs Runtime Words
- `constant` is compile-only - can't use inside definitions
- Must define constants at top level, not inside word definitions
- Other compile-only words: `create`, `variable`, `value` (when defining)

## Dictionary and Search Operations
- `lookup` expects counted strings (len+data), not addr/len pairs
- Use `place` to convert addr/len to counted string for lookup
- `walk>` is incompatible with locals - use `private` values instead

## Object-Oriented Programming
- Use `||` prefix for private/temporary definitions (not `--` or `__`)
- `'s property` syntax for object property access  
- `[[` object context takes address parameter: `obj [[ ... ]]`
- Property access pattern: `obj 's field-name @`

## Stack Comments
- Use `type:name` format for primitives: `n:level`, `f:flag`, `xt:condition`
- Objects use just class name: `contract`, `condition`, `temp-state`
- Multiple objects of same type can have names: `src:contract dst:contract`

## String Handling
- `place` copies addr/len to counted string buffer
- `count` converts counted string to addr/len
- MPE locals syntax for buffers: `{: params | buffer[ size ] :}`
- Reference buffers with bracket: `buffer[ place`, `buffer[ count`

## Error Handling
- `abort"` doesn't provide stack traces in VFX Forth
- Consider custom error reporting with context before aborting
- Manual stack traces: `last @`, `latest`, `.s` for debugging info

## VFXLand5 Specific Patterns
- Array operations: `*stack` creates anonymous arrays, `push`/`pop` for stack ops
- Class definitions: `class: name% ... property field ... class;`
- Object creation: `class% object` returns object address
- Private scoping: `private ... public` for file-local definitions
- Dictionary pattern: `dictionary name` creates key/value structures

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Don't declare loop counters as locals (they're automatic)
- Don't use compile-only words inside definitions
- Don't mix locals with `walk>` operations
- Don't assume `addr len` when API expects counted strings
- Don't use `--` for private words (use `||` instead)

## Debugging Tips
- Add entry logs: `s" ENTER: function-name" log-debug` for tracing
- Use `.s` to see stack state when debugging
- Check `depth` before/after operations to verify stack balance
- Use `abort` with custom messages rather than `abort"` for better context
