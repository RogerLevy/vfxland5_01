current words:
	try (engineer.vfx)
		loads any forth script, reloads last loaded script, reloads dependencies if honing is on
	ld (engineer.vfx)
		loads projects	
	rld (engineer.vfx)
		reload current project
	update (supershow/tools.vfx)
		loads actor scripts and updates instances
		**PROBLEM**: This word can be used to update the current actor's class.  So we need to keep it around, directly usable and as a factor of the new LD.
	run (darkblue/event.vfx)
		loads and executes events, creates private vocab
	require-event <filename.vfx>
		looks specifically in "events\", creates private vocab


proposed improved system:

	ld <searchterm>
		consolidates functionality of TRY, UPDATE, and RUN
		(Engineer provides base LD, Supershow extends via hook for actor detection)

		search order:
			current working directory
			subdirs

			current project directory (if any)
			subdirs (except cwd)
			
			engineer home directory
			subdirs (except cwd and project)

		detect projects
			absolute path matches "projectname/projectname.vfx"?
				cwd to project directory
				honing off
				cartridge
				repl on

		detect actor classes (via Supershow hook)
			path contains: "scripts/"
				after loading, call init-by-class to reinitialize instances
				(same functionality as UPDATE command)

        automatic extension
            `ld test-totem`

		paths still work, though likely rarely needed.
            `ld events/event1.vfx`
            `ld ../test/test1.vfx`

        excluded folders
            */.*

            */node_modules
            */bin
            */dat
            */doc

	ld (no searchterm)
		reload last loaded script (not project)
		saves last loaded filepath like TRY
			was an actor class loaded (scripts/ in path)? (via Supershow hook)
				call init-by-class to reinitialize instances
				(same functionality as UPDATE command)

	rld - reload project
        honing off
        cartridge
        repl on
		
    INCLUDE and REQUIRE are enhanced with the smart path search of LD

        start with the original behavior by checking existence of the given pathspec

    INCLUDED and REQUIRED are left alone
