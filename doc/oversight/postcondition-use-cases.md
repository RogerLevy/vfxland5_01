# Postcondition Use Cases for Oversight

Practical examples of postcondition validations in game development and system programming.

## Memory Management Validation

```forth
crucial test: check-allocation-success ( addr ior -- addr ior n:result )
    over 0= if 0 s" Allocation failed" log-error exit then -1 ;

after allocate check-allocation-success drop
```
**Use case**: Verify memory allocation succeeded before caller assumes valid pointer.

## State Consistency Checks

```forth
crucial test: check-actor-spawned ( -- n:result )
    #actors @ max-actors < 0= if 
        0 s" Actor pool exhausted" log-error exit 
    then -1 ;

after spawn-enemy check-actor-spawned drop
```
**Use case**: Ensure system limits aren't exceeded after spawning game objects.

## File Operation Verification

```forth
crucial test: check-file-written ( bytes-written ior -- bytes-written ior n:result )
    dup 0<> if 0 s" File write failed" log-error exit then 
    over 0= if 1 s" Zero bytes written" log-warning exit then -1 ;

after save-game check-file-written drop
```
**Use case**: Verify file operations completed successfully with expected byte counts.

## Data Structure Integrity

```forth
crucial test: check-list-integrity ( list -- list n:result )
    dup list-valid? 0= if 0 s" List corruption detected" log-error exit then -1 ;

after remove-item check-list-integrity drop
after insert-item check-list-integrity drop
```
**Use case**: Detect data structure corruption after modification operations.

## Performance Monitoring

```forth
charmful test: check-frame-time ( -- n:result )
    frame-time @ 16 > if 1 s" Frame time exceeded 16ms" log-warning exit then -1 ;

after think check-frame-time drop
after render check-frame-time drop
```
**Use case**: Monitor performance bottlenecks in game loop components.

## Resource Cleanup Verification

```forth
crucial test: check-handles-closed ( -- n:result )
    open-handles @ 0<> if 1 s" Resource handles still open" log-warning exit then -1 ;

after cleanup-level check-handles-closed drop
```
**Use case**: Ensure proper resource cleanup in level transitions.

## Graphics State Validation

```forth
crucial test: check-render-state ( -- n:result )
    current-shader @ 0= if 0 s" No shader bound after setup" log-error exit then
    viewport-valid? 0= if 0 s" Invalid viewport after resize" log-error exit then -1 ;

after setup-rendering check-render-state drop
after resize-viewport check-render-state drop
```
**Use case**: Verify graphics pipeline is in valid state after configuration changes.

## Audio System Verification

```forth
crucial test: check-audio-channels ( -- n:result )
    active-channels @ max-channels > if 
        1 s" Audio channel limit exceeded" log-warning exit 
    then -1 ;

after play-sound check-audio-channels drop
after stream-music check-audio-channels drop
```
**Use case**: Monitor audio system resource usage and prevent channel exhaustion.

## Network Operation Validation

```forth
crucial test: check-packet-sent ( bytes-sent ior -- bytes-sent ior n:result )
    dup 0<> if 0 s" Network send failed" log-error exit then
    over 1024 > if 1 s" Large packet sent" log-warning exit then -1 ;

after send-game-state check-packet-sent drop
```
**Use case**: Verify network operations complete successfully and monitor bandwidth usage.

## Database Transaction Verification

```forth
crucial test: check-transaction-committed ( result -- result n:result )
    dup transaction-success <> if 
        0 s" Database transaction failed" log-error exit 
    then -1 ;

after save-player-data check-transaction-committed drop
after update-high-scores check-transaction-committed drop
```
**Use case**: Ensure database operations complete successfully with proper transaction handling.

## Why Postconditions Excel

**Output validation** - Check results meet expected criteria
**Side effect verification** - Confirm operations had intended effects  
**System state monitoring** - Detect corruption after modifications
**Performance tracking** - Monitor timing and resource usage
**Contract enforcement** - Verify functions fulfill their promises

Postconditions are particularly valuable for catching **subtle bugs** where functions complete without error but produce incorrect results or leave the system in an invalid state.

## Best Practices

1. **Check success indicators** - Validate error codes, return values, and status flags
2. **Monitor resource usage** - Track memory, handles, and system limits
3. **Verify side effects** - Ensure operations had expected impact on system state
4. **Performance boundaries** - Alert when operations exceed time/resource budgets
5. **Data consistency** - Validate invariants after state modifications
