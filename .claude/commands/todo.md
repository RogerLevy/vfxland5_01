Add a task to doc/general-todo.txt

The task's summary should concisely summarize "$ARGUMENTS" with a short 1-2 line
description, unless otherwise specified.  (For example if "$ARGUMENTS" contains
a phrase like "with a detailed description" or "summarize <document>" or "no description".

Use proper capitalization and punctuation even if the user didn't.

Add subtask(s) to existing related tasks.
Reference the previous message from the user if unsure which task to put it under.

"Task1 and subtask Task2" = "Create Task1 with subtask Task2"

Tasks are sorted by newest to oldest.
