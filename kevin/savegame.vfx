\ Caverns of Kevin Savegame
\
\ Auto-save system for Caverns of Kevin
\ The idea is you can't just rage quit and start a new game - the only way to
\ start a new game is to die (or delete the save file because you're a lameoid).
\ Why is this important to me?  I really want the player to feel like Kevin's
\ life is real, and their journeys together - long or short - are real.  
\ In this game you can "mess up" only to discover an alternate way, as in real
\ life. I want the player to learn this early on and never give up. (Though, 
\ there are deadly traps, but there are no softlocks.)
\ When you quit, the game automatically saves the entire game state,
\ which is the inventory, some variables, the world map, and each screen's
\ actors.  The actor's scripts are responsible for saving any specific 
\ actor state via the PEEKED message, because only class, position and priority
\ are automatically saved.
\ If the save file exists, it is automatically resumed instead of the title
\ screen appearing.
