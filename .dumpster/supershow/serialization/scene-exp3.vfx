\ i thought about going all the way with a packed binary format for maximum efficiency and 
\ security, and making it incredibly convenient to serialize or deserialize on-the-fly.    
\ something i think Forth is suited to.  
\ 
\ for example defining a scene...

50 50 at ship one [[ 0 id ! 100 hp ! ]] 
100 100 at turret one [[ 1 id ! 1 attach 50 hp ! ]]

save-scene scene1
    \ action:
    s" scene1.scn" delete-file
    s" scene1.scn" object to scene
    scene save



scene1 load  \ bring out the ship and turret again later

\ make some changes ...          

scene1 save  \ update
