\ a different approach...
\ i'd like to store scene data as *compiled* Forth code
\ this way is more flexible: 
\ - can be directly pasted into REPL 
\ - performance or security concerns

\ new example serialization output
:scene
    ship one [[ 0 id ! 50. x ! 50. y ! ]]
    turret one [[ 1 id ! 0 attach 100. x ! 100. y ! ]]
;
\ we just need to include the file, no custom parser needed

class: scene
    forth-asset derive
    prop scene-xt
class;

scene :: load ( - )
    scene-xt @ execute ;

scene :: refresh ( - )
    srcpath count included ;

scene :: save ( - )
    s[ print-actors s] srcpath count write 
    me refresh ;

: :scene ( - )
    :noname scene-xt ! ;
