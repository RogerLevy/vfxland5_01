2024-12-19 features (i wanted to assure myself that it's all necessary)
- Setup: create window (windowed or fullscreen with toggle support)
- Go: main loop, runs application, handles Allegro events, tries to sandbox errors
- Hooks: necessary application hooks
- Misc: misc utility words
- Modules: private/public
- Allegro 5: imports and utilities
- Fixed-point: extension

It definitely came out more complicated than I thought!
Judging by the number of "parts" though, the API's size seems about what I planned on. :)
