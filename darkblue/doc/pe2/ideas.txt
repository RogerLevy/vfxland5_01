## Commands

- [ ] select a range by clicking and dragging near curve and/or with the keyboard for precision
- [ ] thin ( - ) - remove all duplicates (removes pauses)
- [ ] speed ( start. end. - ) - recalculate selection's velocity (drawing an imaginary curved line through the existing selected points as reference) given in pixels per frame
- [ ] time ( n - ) - make selection last given frames (similar to `speed`)
- [ ] linear ( - ) - generate linear path between first and last point, replacing the selected points but maintaining the count
- [ ] blur ( - ) - progressively smooth selection
- [ ] return ( n - ) - generate a linear path lasting given frames, to the beginning of the path
- [ ] back ( - ) - move selection back by selection's length, cropping to beginning
- [ ] fwd ( - ) - move selection forward by selection's length, cropping to end
- [ ] rate ( n - ) - duplicate every point in selection n times, creating low-framerate effect


## General Functionality

- switch between paths in memory
- cut/copy/paste range
- insert markers (a separate list)
- save/load
- live update in game
- record modes: replace all, replace selection, append, insert after selection

    looping: true
    points[
        0.0 0.0
        1.0 1.0
        ...
    points]

    var marker-dict
class;

paths location = paths\

load-paths ( - )
    creates path% objects named like <name>.path
    
save-path ( path addr:name len:name - )
    save path to (no filepath or ext)
    creates a copy if name doesn't match original
    
create-path ( addr:name len:name - )
    creates a path object file and named object in the dictionary (<name>.path)
    
load-path ( addr:name len:name - path )
    loads a path object from filespec (no filepath or ext) and returns it
    replaces path object if it exists in the dictionary
    - sets looping var
    - creates point array
    - creates marker dictionary
