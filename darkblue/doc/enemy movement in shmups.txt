2D shoot'em ups use several common patterns for enemy movement:

Path-based movement: Enemies follow predefined curves or waypoints. Classic
patterns include sine waves, spirals, and zigzags. Games often use spline
curves or mathematical functions to create smooth, predictable paths.

Formation flying: Groups of enemies maintain relative positions while moving
together, like the iconic Galaga enemy swarms or R-Type's snake-like chains.

Homing/tracking: Enemies adjust their movement to pursue the player. This
ranges from simple direction changes toward the player's position to more
sophisticated prediction algorithms.

State-based behavior: Enemies switch between movement modes - entering from
screen edges, attacking in formation, then breaking off into individual
patterns.

Scripted sequences: Timed movement commands that create dramatic moments, like
enemies swooping in specific patterns or bosses with multi-phase movement
routines.

Physics-based: Some enemies use momentum, acceleration, and collision responses
rather than pure positional updates.

Most games combine these approaches - enemies might enter via formation flying,
break into individual sine wave patterns, then switch to homing behavior when
players get close. The key is balancing predictability (so players can learn
patterns) with enough variation to stay engaging.
