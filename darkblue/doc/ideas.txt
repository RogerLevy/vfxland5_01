tris = life and ammunition
slight repulsion
when you get hit, 1~? tris come out



dark blue (normal mode, and also the demo?)
    impervious
    background doesn't change
    no barriers
    no leaderboard
    demo: when you reach the boss, you get a screen that says "END OF DEMO"    
    
    solo ending in monochrome
    
    
break thru (resilient mode, the real game)
    death + auto respawn for 100 tris
    game over when out of tris
    background changes color in certain situations
    3 barriers to break thru
    online ending in color, steal tris from each other
        or work together to get more tris
    leaderboard


after beating break thru for the first time, you unlock normal +,
    which is the normal mode but with color and maybe some new secrets

the emergence of color should feel exciting
as should the encounter with the boss after purchasing the game
